// in the interpolation then a ref must be used

   *       or maybe even while dragging, but probably requires a more restrictive CSS.
   *       As in now the sticky footer isn't overlapping the content, allowing `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)` effects.
   *       A FLIP resize flow for content height would likely require the sticky elements to overlap the content area.
   *       Could be done as a separat mode though, or a separate example CSS for max performance.
